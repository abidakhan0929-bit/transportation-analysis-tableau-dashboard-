# Transportation Analysis Dashboard (Tableau + JSON Dataset)

This project explores different types of transportation available between various Indian cities.  
I created a custom **JSON dataset** with 20 sample trips and used **Tableau Public** to design an interactive dashboard that highlights important travel patterns and fare insights.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following fields:

- **TripID**
- **Source**
- **Destination**
- **TransportType** (Bus, Cab, Train, Flight, Ferry, Metro)
- **Operator**
- **Distance (km)**
- **Duration (mins)**
- **Fare (₹)**
- **Departure Time**
- **Availability Status**

The file used in this project:  
`transport_trips.json`

## 📊 Dashboard Features

### **1. KPI Cards**
- Total Fare
- Average Fare
- Total Trips

### **2. Visuals Included**
- **Trips by Transport Type** (bar chart)  
- **Fare by Type** (bar chart)  
- **Distance vs Fare** (scatter plot)  
- **Trips Over Time** (date-based bar chart)

### **3. Filters**
- Transport Type
- Availability

These make the dashboard interactive and allow users to explore insights quickly.
